# ML, DL, NLP, & CV Projects.
This repository showcases a collection of AI projects that demonstrate my skills in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project includes Jupyter notebooks, descriptions, installation instructions, and usage examples, making it easy to explore and learn from.
Feel free to browse the projects, and if you have any suggestions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## Project List

### Project 1: [Video Game Sales Analysis](https://github.com/MoosaMemon/ML-DL-NLP-CV-Projects/tree/main/Video%20Game%20Sales%20Analysis)
**Description:** Explores video game sales data using data analysis and machine learning techniques to extract insights and build predictive models.
### Project 2: [Fake News Detection System](https://github.com/MoosaMemon/ML-DL-NLP-CV-Projects/tree/main/Fake%20News%20Detection%20System)
**Description:** Utilizing NLP and machine learning algorithms, this project detects fake news from labeled news articles.
### Project 3: [NLP Text-Processing](https://github.com/MoosaMemon/ML-DL-NLP-CV-Projects/tree/main/NLP%20Text-Processing)
**Description:** A collection of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) text preprocessing notebooks demonstrating core techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and named entity recognition.
### Project 4: [Employee Churn Prediction System (ANN)](https://github.com/MoosaMemon/ML-DL-NLP-CV-Projects/tree/main/Churn%20Modeling%20(ANN))
**Description:** Builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave an organization based on employee-related features. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), ANN model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using techniques such as early stopping.
### Project 5: [Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction System (ANN)](https://github.com/MoosaMemon/ML-DL-NLP-CV-Projects/tree/main/Pima%20Indians%20Diabetes%20(ANN))
**Description:** Develops an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the onset of diabetes using medical diagnostic data. The project covers data preprocessing, EDA, ANN-based classification, hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, and model evaluation, focusing on healthcare-related predictive modeling.
