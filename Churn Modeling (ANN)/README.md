# Employee Churn Prediction System

This project utilizes a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling) of employee details to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts whether an employee will churn in the future.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Application of machine learning algorithms:
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner
  - Finding the number of hidden layers
  - Determining the number of neurons in each hidden layer
  - Identifying the appropriate dropout ratio for dropout layers
- Model training and evaluation
- Neural Network techniques:
  - Activation function: ReLU
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Early stopping to find the appropriate number of epochs

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the ability to work with employee data, perform data analysis, and apply deep learning techniques to build a predictive model for employee churn prediction. The dataset includes columns such as estimated salary, age, sex, etc., providing comprehensive details about each employee.
