# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction System

This project utilizes a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?resource=download) of medical details to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Application of machine learning algorithms:
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner
  - Finding the number of hidden layers
  - Determining the number of neurons in each hidden layer
  - Identifying the appropriate dropout ratio for dropout layers
  - Finding the appropriate activation function for hidden layers
  - Finding the appropriate optimizer for backpropagation
- Model training and evaluation
- Neural Network techniques:
  - Early stopping to find the appropriate number of epochs

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the ability to work with medical data, perform data analysis, and apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for diabetes onset prediction. The dataset includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. All patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
